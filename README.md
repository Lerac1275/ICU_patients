# Introduction

This project contains the notebooks and files used for a data science project task.

# notebooks
This is the main folder for this project, containing the notebook files used in :
1. Preprocessing the dataset (`1. preprocessing.ipynb`)
2. Doing some exploratory data analysis on the dataset (`2. analysis.ipynb`)
3. Conducting the __model training and evaluation__ for this machine learning task. (`3. Model Training.ipynb`)<br>
    This is the notebook with the infromation most relevant to this data science project. 

This folder also contains `helper.py`, which houses some custom utility function used in plotting and tabulation within `3. Model Training.ipynb`. 

# datasets
This folder contains the raw data used for this task (`ICU_raw.csv`) along with the preprocessed version saved to an sqlite db (`ICU_data.sqlite`)
